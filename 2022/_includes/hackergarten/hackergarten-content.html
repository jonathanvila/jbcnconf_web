<p>The point is to <strong>work on an Open Source of your choice</strong> in order to fix a bug, create a feature, write a blog post, create a video, or anything else you might think of that can be a contribution to the chosen project.
Also, <strong>if you ever wanted ot contribute to a project and don&#8217;t know how</strong>, we will help you.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll hack on anything as long as itâ€™s Open Source, no matter the programming language, platform, IDE, etc.
This will be a <strong>welcoming open space regardless of your skill level</strong>.
Whether you are an experienced developer, a junior developer or a student, you are more than welcome to join.
<strong>We guarantee that you&#8217;ll learn something</strong> ðŸ˜„</p>
