                                    Barcelona has undergone a transformation in recent years. It’s always been looked upon as a city of great
                                    thinkers, artists and architects, but now it can add “smart city” and “innovative startup hub”
                                    to its repertoire, rendering it a prime location for technology and attracting increasing numbers of international
                                    talent to its shores.

                                    The quarter is the centre of the old city of Barcelona, built primarily in the late 19th and early 20th century,
                                    though several buildings date from medieval times.
                                    The Barri Gòtic retains a labyrinthine street plan, with many small streets opening out into squares. <br/>
                                    It stretches from Plaça de Catalunya to the marina (near the seafront), edged the famous La Rambla street.

                                    This beach is inextricably linked to the fishing quarter of the same name, Barceloneta, Barcelona's classic
                                    neighbourhood by the sea, where the people of Barcelona love to come and eat fish and seafood dishes and "tapas".
